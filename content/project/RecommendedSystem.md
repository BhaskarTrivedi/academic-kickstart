Recommender System<br/>
Purpose of this project to develop a scale recommended system from scratch. Best approch to learn any concept is to implement it from scratch <br/>
Abstract:<br/>
Recommender System / Machine is developed to suggest end user with the product ( can be anything likes movies, sports, food etc.) based on user interest. There are many ways to predict about end user interest. One of the most popular ways to keep track of user past, interest and suggest him/her according to his/her history(commonly known as content based recommendation). The positive side of this approach , it is simple and easy to develop, but the downside of it, the user may get monotonous suggestion and every time he will get the same kind of suggested product. Other approach can be a collaborative recommendation, where user not only get recommendations based on his/her interest but, also based on other similar user who matches with his/her interest to certain thresholds. It helps user to explore new area which he did not explore, but he may find it interesting once introduce it to them. <br/>
